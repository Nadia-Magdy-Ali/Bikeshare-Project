# Bikeshare-Project
In this project, I'm using Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, I'm useing data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

## Statistics Computed
1- Popular times of travel: (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

2- Popular stations and trip:
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3- Trip duration:
- total travel time
- average travel time

4- User info:
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Python 3, NumPy, and pandas
Git Bash

### Executing program
- Download Bikeshare-project and unzip file
- Right click to any blank area inside the repository 'folder' and choose 'Git Bash Here'.
- In the Git Bash window type "ipython bikeshre.py"
- You will be asked to enter the name of the city you would like to explore its data along with the month and the day.
